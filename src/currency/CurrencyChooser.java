     * 2-letter ISO-3166 code for the country, in this case AZ. It was removed
     * the next year, but remains in Java's currency information file.</li>
     * <li>The Bulgarian hard lev (BGL), I'm not sure how it differs from the
     * Bulgarian lev (BGN).</li>
     * <li>The Bolivian MVDOL (BOV), a monetary unit managed by the Banco
     * Central de Bolivia. The MVDOL correlates the modern boliviano (BOB) to
     * the United States dollar (USD). The MVDOL is used for financial
     * instruments like treasury bills. From what I understand, it's not used
     * for everyday expenses like buying groceries, nor for tourists' expenses,
     * like booking a hotel.</li>
     * <li>The WIR euro (CHE), a "community currency" that is equal in value to
     * the euro (EUR), but is not traded outside of Switzerland.</li>
     * <li>The WIR franc (CHW), a "community currency" that is equal in value to
     * the Swiss franc (CHF).</li>
     * <li>The Guinea-Bissau peso (GWP) was the official currency of
     * Guinea-Bissau from 1976 to 1997. It was originally traded at par with the
     * Portuguese escudo (PTE), but it was already overvalued at that rate. In
     * 1997, it was replaced by the West African CFA franc (XOF).</li>
     * <li>The Malagasy franc (MGF) was the official currency of Madagascar
     * until 2005. It has been phased out in favor of the Malagasy ariary
     * (MGA).</li>
     * <li>The Surinamese guilder (SRG) was the currency of Suriname until 2004,
     * when it was replaced by the Surinamese dollar (SRD) at a rate of a
     * thousand guilder for one dollar.</li>
     * <li>The S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; &amp; Pr&iacute;ncipe dobra (STN) is still
     * a valid currency, as far as I can tell, but Manny's Currency Converter
     * does not recognize it, instead recognizing the earlier dobra (STD), which
     * was valid from 1977 to 2017.</li>
     * <li>The Timorese escudo (TPE) was the official currency of Portuguese
     * Timor prior to occupation by Indonesia.</li>
     * <li>The same day U.&nbsp;S. dollar (USS) and the next day U.&nbsp;S.
     * dollar (USN), which serve special purposes in some contexts but are
     * generally not recognized by currency conversion APIs.</li>
     * <li>The so-called "bolivar dig&iacute;tal is excluded because, despite
     * its official standing, is not recognized by some currency conversion
     * APIs.</li>
     * <li>The Zimbabwean dollar (ZWN) is in limbo as far as Java's runtime is
     * concerned. Although another Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL) is recognized by
     * Manny's free currency conversion API, Java's currency information file
     * lists it as a historical currency that was valid only in 2009. Whatever
     * the case may be, tourists are perhaps best served bringing U.&nbsp;S.
     * dollars.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>Also, the former currencies of the European nations that now use the
     * euro (EUR) are not marked as historical in the currency information file.
     * In the case of the founding nations of the eurozone, the euro was
     * introduced in 1999 but the old national currency continued to be valid
     * until 2002. Some of the old notes and coins can still be exchanged to
     * euros, but this varies from country to country. These are the
     * euro-replaced currencies this currency chooser specifically excludes:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>The Andorran peseta (ADP) was a currency of Andorra in the
     * 20<sup>th</sup> Century. It was pegged to the Spanish peseta (ESP) at
     * 1:1.</li>
     * <li>The Austrian schilling (ATS) was the official currency of Austria
     * from 1925 to 2002 except during World War II and shortly before. The old
     * notes and coins can be exchanged for euros indefinitely.</li>
     * <li>The Belgian franc (BEF) was the official currency of Belgium from
     * 1832 to 2002. The old coins can no longer be exchanged for euros, but
     * there's no time limit for exchanging the old notes.</li>
     * <li>The Cypriot pound (CYP) was a currency of Cyprus until 2008, when it
     * was replaced by the euro. The old notes and coins can no longer be
     * exchanged for euros.</li>
     * <li>The German mark (DEM) was the official currency of West Germany from
     * 1948 to 1990 and of unified Germany from 1990 to 2002. The old notes and
     * coins can be exchanged for euros indefinitely.</li>
     * <li>The Estonian kroon (EEK) was the official currency of Estonia from
     * 1992 to 2011. The old notes and coins can be exchanged for euros at the
     * country's central bank indefinitely.</li>
     * <li>The Spanish peseta (ESP) was the official currency of Spain from 1868
     * to 2002. After June 30, 2021, the old notes and coins can no longer be
     * exchanged for euros.</li>
     * <li>The Finnish markka (FIM) was the official currency of Finland from
     * 1860 to 2002. The old notes and coins can no longer be exchanged for
     * euros.</li>
     * <li>The French franc (FRF) was the official currency of France from 1960
     * to 2002, though its history dates back to 1795 and earlier. The old notes
     * and coins can no longer be exchanged for euros.</li>
     * <li>The Greek drachma (GRD) was valid until 2002, as was the case with
     * the currencies of several other countries that joined the eurozone in
     * 1999. The old notes and coins can no longer be exchanged for euros.</li>
     * <li>The Irish pound (IEP) was the official currency of Ireland  until
     * 2002. Old Irish pound notes and coins can be exchanged for euros at the
     * Central Bank of Ireland indefinitely.</li>
     * <li>The Italian lira (ITL) was the only official currency of Italy from
     * 1861 to 1999. The old notes and coins can no longer be exchanged for
     * euros.</li>
     * <li>The Luxembourgian franc (LUF) was the official currency of Luxembourg
     * from 1854 to 2002 except during World War II. But even after the war,
     * some other countries' currencies were accepted in Luxembourg. That
     * nation's residents have been characterized as enthusiastic adopters of
     * the euro, which was introduced in 1999. The old coins can no longer be
     * exchanged for euros. However, the old notes can be exchanged
     * indefinitely.</li>
     * <li>The Maltese lira (MTL) was valid until 2008. Malta joined the
     * European Union in 2004, after most of the other nations of the union had
     * phased out their own old currencies. So the phasing out period for the
     * lira was pretty much the whole year 2008. The old notes and coins can no
     * longer be exchanged for euros.</li>
     * <li>The Dutch guilder (NLG), also called the florin, was valid until
     * 2002. The old coins can no longer be exchanged for euros. However, the
     * old notes can exchanged until January 1, 2032, with some conditions.</li>
     * <li>The Portuguese escudo (PTE) was the official currency of Portugal
     * from 1911 to 2002. The old notes and coins can no longer be exchanged for
     * euros.</li>
     * <li>The Slovenian tolar (SIT) was the official currency of Slovenia from
     * 1991 to 2007. The old coins can no longer be exchanged for euros, but the
     * old notes can be exchanged for euros indefinitely.</li>
